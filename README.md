# Unit 2 Retrospective

## Accomplishments/What we did right

- Project proposals / planning made the project easier to tackle rather than having an intimidating blank slate
- Plan correctly, talk to other people about your plan as well to make sure it's achievable within the time period given -- you're not wasting time while planning
- Putting thought in the app design for the user experience, usability, and just overall design 
- React hooks, helped with understanding patterns and how React works
- But also being able to use state seemed more comfortable
- Teamwork! Working with each other, being willing to help each other and encourage each other
- Doing research on your own first before getting help, becoming more self-sufficient

## Problem Areas

- Being at the mercy of a 3rd party API caused a lot of panic
- Heroku deployment, understanding the given instructions, being able to follow them and implement them 
- Be sure to read through everything before getting set up to ensure you're setting up correctly

## Learnings / Takeaways

- Don't be afraid to write messy code first because you can always go back and refactor it afterwards, get MVP first!
- Balance between messy code and optimized code 
- Moving out of your comfort zone, don't be afraid to break things
- Commit early, commit often - same with deployment, it's much easier to debug if you do so often.
- Don't be stubborn, get better at asking for help
- Asking questions through the issue queue was helpful in knowing how to articulate your question, useful for real world applications
- Writing questions is like rubber ducking, can help you figure out the answer to your own question

## Future Directions

- Make a backup plan! Especially when working with 3rd party API's 
- Test things out! Be sure everything works before you get too far
- Continue to solidify your JS/React fundamentals, sets you up for working with whatever JS based frameworks you may work with in the future
- Focus on developing your ability to learn
- Also react hooks, if didn't use them during this project
